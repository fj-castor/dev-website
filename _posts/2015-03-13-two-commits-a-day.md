It took over 2 months since I said I would, but I finally have my first post on a blog I've been meaning to start for a loooooonnng time. Before I started my 4 month internship in January, I kept telling myself that it would be the perfect time to start one up. I kept saying how I could write about things like work, life in Boston, my hometown (and currently in a funk) Toronto Raptors, etc., but up until now it's been all talk and no follow through.
