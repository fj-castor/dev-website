Hey! I'm Francis and I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student and software developer.

I've been involved in various jobs and projects that involved developing mobile apps, front-end website and web applications, and back-end services. I'm passionate about solving everyday problems and providing great experiences through technology.

Feel free to check out past work I've done and projects I'm currently involved in too!
